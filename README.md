# OpenSource_Project_Guidelines üöÄ

This repository is designed to assist in creating repositories for Open-Source projects.

Setting up a well-structured open-source project repository is crucial for its success. Remembering all the necessary components for a new repository can be cumbersome. The following guidelines aim to simplify the creation and initiation of a new project repository.

Workflow:
- Create a new Private Repository from this template repository.
- Check each box until all the following files are updated with the correct project name.
  - [ ] .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md
  - [ ] .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/documentation-issue.md
  - [ ] .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md
  - [ ] .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
  - [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md
  - [ ] CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
  - [ ] README.md
  - [ ] LICENSE.md
- The LICENSE by default would be GPL3 but can be changed according to use.
- Initialize the repository.
- Change the visibility to Public (when ready to make it public).
- The Open Source Project is Initialized.
